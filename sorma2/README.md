# Sorma<sup>2</sup> - Simple ORM(Android)<sup>2</sup>

It is based on the wonderful https://github.com/maskarade/Android-Orma by [FUJI Goro](https://github.com/gfx)
<br>
<br>
This is a rewrite in pure java, to generate most stuff you need and then add it to your project
either as a ```.jar file``` or as ```java source```.<br>
You still need to add ```sqlite-jdbc-3.46.1.2.jar``` to your project to use it.<br>
<br><br>
~~sadly [sqlite-jdbc](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc) project decided that it needs ```slf4j-api jar``` (for no good reason).~~
this was solved by: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/pull/1178
